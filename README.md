# Sentiment Analysis on Clothing, Shoes, and Jewelry Reviews

This project uses the Clothing, Shoes, and Jewelry dataset to build a model that predicts customer sentiment based on their reviews. The dataset contains reviews and ratings (1-5 stars) which are categorized into sentiment groups. The goal is to classify the sentiment of each review into "like", "dislike", or "neutral" based on the overall rating.

## Introduction

The Sentiment Analysis on Clothing, Shoes, and Jewelry Reviews project aims to classify customer feedback into sentiment categories. By analyzing review text and corresponding ratings, the project seeks to understand customer satisfaction and provide insights for improving product offerings.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Clothing, Shoes, and Jewelry dataset from Amazon reviews, which can be found [here](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/).

- **File**: `Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5.json` (inside `reviews_Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5.json.gz`)
- **Columns**:
  - `reviewText`: Text of the review.
  - `overall`: Rating given by the customer (1 to 5 stars).

## Objectives
